# ChangelognnAll notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.nnThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](httpkeepachangelog.comen1.0.0)nand this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](httpsemver.orgspecv2.0.0.html).nn## [1.1.1] - 2021-10-04nn### Fixednn Fixed pulling frame data from the Profiler to exclude first and last frames if their main thread profiler data is incomplete, so that they don't skewer the analysis results [(case 1359686)](httpsissuetracker.unity3d.comproductunityissuesguid1359686).n Fixed IndexOutOfRangeException thrown when using Profiler or selecting Profiler frames in Profile Analyzer. [(1366931)](httpsissuetracker.unity3d.comproductunityissuesguid1366931)nn## [1.1.0] - 2021-07-23nn### Fixednn Fixed x axis display on frame time graph when capture doesn't match Unity Profiler contents.n Fixed selected marker name to be updated even when Profiler fails to sync selection.nn## [1.1.0-pre.2] - 2021-04-16nn### Changednn Ensured forward compilation compatibility of ProfilerWindow API usage.nn### Fixednn Fixed Frame View Dropdown not showing time in Microseconds when Microseconds are set as display unit type.n Fixed ArgurmentOutOfRange exception on 'Clear Selection' usage in Frame Control.n Improved loading and analysis progressbar progression to be monotonously incremental and reflect actual stage correctly.n Fixed the marked frame time overlay so that it works on loaded data (case 1327888).n Fixed keyboard frame controls so that they do not play an error sound (case 1327931).n Fixed RangeSettings.IsEqual so that it doesn't throw an exception when there is a different dataView.selectedIndices.nn## [1.1.0-pre.1] - 2021-02-22nn### Changednn Used the new `EditorWindow.docked` API on 2020.1 and later to replace reflection usage.  n Made the Thread Selection window a utility window.n Added a progress bar, which shows data loading progress.n All no longer collapses in the thread view because it was superfluous and held no discernible purpose.n Added information to the frame summary tooltip to show the selected ranges.n Selecting the Frame, Thread, and Marker Summary title labels now also toggles their foldout.n Timings in tooltips now display up to seven digits with a unit type change if below 0.01. This ensures the value is readable and correct.n Frame Time Graph selection modifiers (Next, Previous, Grow, Shrink etc.) now work when multiple regions are selected.n Added new (hidden) columns to the comparison tab for Percentage Diff for each of the diff typesn The Depth Slice drop-down is searchable and scrollable for Unity versions 2019.1 or newer.n Improved tooltips on the top 10 marker duration time.nn### Fixednn The Thread Summary and Marker Summary views now correctly clip their contents when scrolling on 2018.4 and below.n Marker detail bars are no longer drawn on top of the list's headers when scrolling.n Fixed an issue with saving when there is no data loaded, which previously caused a null reference exception.n Add to and Remove from name filter is no longer case sensitive.n Optimized frame selection with Show Filtered Threads option enabled and All Threads turned on.n Fixed an issue where the Upper Quartile of frame time option did not fit in the Graph scale dropdown in Thread Summary.n Improved the error message when the Profile Analyzer fails to load a .data file.n Fixed an issue where changing the depth slice and right-clicking on a marker caused an error in 2018.4 and earlier.n Fixed the automatic increase of an unsaved file counter in Single view.n Improved the Marker Column mode so that it is separate for Single and Compare view.n The tooltip of the frame graph's scale control is now clearer and matches the documentation.n Fixed an issue where a frame of '0' was incorrectly shown in the Marker Summary when the marker had a duration of 0ms.n Fixed an issue with Selection Synchronization between Profiler Window and Profile Analyzer in Unity 2021.1 or newer.n Added a log message when the loading or analysis fails due to domain reload.n Fixed an issue with the table context menu, where it was not disabled during data processing.n Fixed an issue where exporting a marker table that contained markers with commas or quotation marks to the .csv format would break the format.nn## [1.0.3] - 2020-07-31nn### Fixesnn Fixed warnings in code so package will not break Unity projects that have warnings as errors enabled.nn## [1.0.2] - 2020-06-30nn### Fixesnn Fixed issue where second profiler instance could appear after entering play mode when profile analyzer is openn Improved performance of pulling data from Unity profilern Pull Data button now enabled when profiler is recording. This will stop the recording for the duration of the action of pulling of data.n Fixed Median sorting in Comparison mode when value missing from one data set, Missing values always sorted before 0 values.nn## [1.0.1] - 2020-06-16nn### Fixesnn Fixed median marker time (in currently selected frames) in tooltip for 'Top 10 markers'. n Fixed profile analyzer 5.6 supportn Fixed minor visual artefact when no marker selection n Fixed issue where frame time graph tooltips were not always appearing when hoveringn Marker Summary - Count Values are now correctly sorted in descending ordern Hiding selected marker in comparison view if lacking 2 valid data setsn Corrected bucketing of histogram data for counts. Display was fractionally incorrectn Fixed sorting of frames (by timecount) to be more stable by providing a secondary sort by frame indexn Marker table export now orders by descending median time (to match the default UI sort option).nn## [1.0.0] - 2020-06-02nn### Changesnn Export window updates. Includes tooltips, better on screen positioning. n   If opened and then new data set loaded. New data set now correctly exported.n Frame Time graph now shows border when selectedn   Keys 1 and 2 select the first or second frame time graph to take keyboard focusn Frame Time graph now shows highlighted when all frames selected, un highlighted when no frames selected.nn### Fixesnn Improved histogram display when 0 range.n Widened frame index buttons when frame value largen 'total number of markers' value in Compare tab now corrected to use unfiltered countn Improved error messages when jumpping to frame when profiler data doesn't match profile analyzer datann## [0.7.0-preview.4] - 2020-05-29nn### Changesnn Thread selection window n   Now only applys thread selection changes when clicking 'Apply'. Closing the window no longer applies the changes automatically.n   Now contains buttons to Reset to previous thread selection, Select just Main Thread or Common set selection (Main, Render and Jobs).n   Apply button is now greyed out while analysis is running.n   Group column enabled and used to split off group from thread name, default to by group firstn   Re sorted when selection changed (so states sort correctly when sorting by state)n   Sort order preserved when buttons pressed and re-openingn   Fixed sort order for threads (10 after 9 rather than between 1 and 2)n Marker sortingn   Marker table column filtering now preserved when clicking Analyse or Compare or tab switching.n   Compare table bars to now sort by bar size (=delta value) rather than the leftright value.n   Marker table bars now start sorted by descending size which is more common usage.n Added depths columns into the comparison table and a 'Depth' option in the Marker Columns dropdownn Added thread count into thread summary arean Added threads column into marker tables (threads the marker occurs on)n Thread summary now contains thread count, unique count per data set and selection countn Frame time area now allows adding to the selection by holding CTRL (or COMMAND on Mac)n Frame range value now includes tooltip to give more detail about the selectionn Improved text string for depth filter status on the top marker displaynn### Fixesnn Detected and ignored invalid frame markers (duration  0)n FixedRemoved warnings on loading data in compare view when selection active.n Disabled Analyze button while analysis is already runningn Fixed Marker Summary 'Top' dropdown selection text widthn Fixed thread selection window sort ordern Fixed tooltip on 'count' bars to be scalar value (not a time unit)n Clamped selected region shown when zoomed in on frame time graphn Frame Control value no longer overlaps with drop-down list when Units are set to Microsecondsn Fixed thread count text when analysis completes after swapping singlecompare tabs during analysisn Fixed Frame View's tooltip total time when rapidly changing frames n Fixed overlapping text when selecting single frame when zoomed inn Histogram frame count now lists 1 frame when single frame rather than 1 framesn Mode text in top bar now same size as rest of text.n Clear Selection in marker right click context menu now only shown if a selection has been maden CutPaste now supported in the includeexclude marker name filtern Frame Time graph frame selection growshrink now keeps current selection in paired graphn Fixed frame startend display for Select Frames that contain this marker (within whole data set)n Corrected bucketing of histogram data.
